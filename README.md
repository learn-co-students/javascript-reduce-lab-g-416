JavaScript Reduce Lab
---

## Objectives

1. Practice using a reduce function
2. Practice iterating over different abstractions

## Introduction
By now, we know that `.reduce()` is nothing more than a function to reduce an array to another value, such as a number,
a string, another array, ... This allows us to easily count word occurrences, calculate a total sum of product prices,
and so on.

In this lab, we'll focus on flexing those `reduce()` muscles! Remember — `Array.prototype.reduce()` takes two
arguments: the `callback` and the `initialValue`.

## Technologic

Pat and Dave are hard at work in the battery factory. They've assembled several batches of batteries today. Let's count
how many assembled batteries we ended up with, while they go out for an oil change.

* Create a new variable called `totalBatteries` which is the sum of all of the battery amounts in the `batteryBatches`
array. Naturally, use `.reduce()` for this!


## Perfecting the monologue

One of the most iconic scenes in Breaking Bad is where Walter White reveals to his wife, Skyler, how deeply entrenched
he is in the meth business. Writing this monologue must have been a pain. For future episodes, it would be great if the
show's writer could get an overview of the amount of sentences mapped by word count.

For example, say we have these two lines:

```js
const lines = [
  'Who are you talking to right now?',
  'Who is it you think you see?',
  'Do you know how much I make a year?',
];
```

Our output would look like this:

```
{ '7': 2, '9': 1 }
```

This output can be interpreted as: _'We have two sentences with 7 words, and one sentence with 9 words'_. That should
help the writer to write even more dramatic monologues!

* Create a new variable called `wordCountMap` that reduces the `monologueLines` to a map that resembles the output as
shown above.
